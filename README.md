# Sorting Algorithms (lab) and Time Testing (task)

This repository contains implementations of simple sorting algorithms and their time complexity and speed analysis

## Algorithms Implemented

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Python sorted()


## Time Complexity

Expected time complexity of each sorting algorithm implemented:

- **Bubble Sort**: O(n^2)
- **Selection Sort**: O(n^2)
- **Merge Sort**: O(n log n)
- **Python Sorted()**: 

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone
    ```
